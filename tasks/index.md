# Remove index.html from URL Display

## Problem
Currently, when accessing the portfolio website, the URL displays `index.html` at the end (e.g., `https://example.com/index.html`). This looks unprofessional and should be cleaned up to show only the base URL (e.g., `https://example.com/`).

## Context
- This is a static portfolio website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- The main entry point is `index.html` in the root directory
- Currently using `live-server` for local development
- The site appears to be hosted as a static site (likely GitHub Pages based on the repository structure)

## Requirements
1. **Primary Goal**: Remove `index.html` from the displayed URL so users see clean URLs
2. **Maintain Functionality**: Ensure all existing functionality continues to work
3. **SEO Friendly**: Ensure search engines can still properly index the site
4. **Cross-browser Compatibility**: Solution should work across all modern browsers

## Potential Solutions to Investigate

### Option 1: Server Configuration (Recommended for Production)
- **For Apache**: Create/modify `.htaccess` file with DirectoryIndex directive
- **For Nginx**: Configure index directive in server block
- **For GitHub Pages**: This is automatically handled - `index.html` files are served as directory indexes

### Option 2: Development Environment Fix
- Modify the `live-server` configuration in `package.json` to serve the root directory properly
- Update the dev script to not explicitly reference `/index.html`

### Option 3: Client-side Redirect (Not Recommended)
- Use JavaScript to detect if URL contains `index.html` and redirect
- This is not SEO-friendly and adds unnecessary complexity

## Implementation Steps
1. **Analyze Current Hosting Setup**: Determine where the site is currently hosted or will be hosted
2. **Choose Appropriate Solution**: Based on hosting environment, select the best approach
3. **Implement Configuration**: Add necessary server configuration files or modify existing ones
4. **Update Development Environment**: Ensure local development also reflects the clean URLs
5. **Test Thoroughly**: Verify that:
   - Root URL loads the homepage correctly
   - Direct access to `/index.html` either works or redirects appropriately
   - All internal links continue to function
   - No broken references to assets or other files

## Files That May Need Modification
- `package.json` (dev script configuration)
- `.htaccess` (if using Apache hosting)
- Any internal links that explicitly reference `index.html`

## Expected Outcome
After implementation:
- Accessing the root domain shows the portfolio without `index.html` in the URL
- The site maintains all current functionality
- Professional, clean URL structure that's better for SEO and user experience

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Root URL (`/`) loads the homepage correctly
- [ ] All navigation links work properly
- [ ] Assets (CSS, JS, images) load correctly
- [ ] No console errors in browser developer tools
- [ ] Site works in both development and production environments
