## Content Management

This website uses a component-based system for easy content management. Instead of editing HTML directly, you can update content by modifying data files.

### File Structure

- `content-data.js` - Contains all content data (episodes, appearances, host info)
- `components.js` - Component generation functions
- `script.js` - Initializes components on page load
- `index.html` - Main HTML structure with component placeholders

### Adding New Episodes

1. Open `content-data.js`
2. Find the `episodes.items` array
3. Add a new episode object:

```javascript
{
    title: 'Your Episode Title',
    type: 'episode',
    image: 'assets/images/episodes/your-image.png',
    description: 'Your episode description here...',
    youtube_link: 'https://youtube.com/your-video',
    spotify_link: 'https://spotify.com/your-episode'
}
```

### Adding Guest Appearances

Follow the same pattern in the `appearances.items` array:

```javascript
{
    title: 'Appearance Title',
    type: 'appearance',
    image: 'assets/images/appearances/your-image.png',
    description: 'Description of the appearance...',
    links: [
        {
            platform: 'youtube',
            url: 'https://youtube.com/appearance-video',
            text: 'YouTube'
        }
    ]
}
```

### Updating Host Information

Modify the `about.items` array to update host profiles:

```javascript
{
    name: 'Host Name',
    pronouns: 'they/them',
    title: 'Host Title',
    image: 'assets/images/about/host-image.jpg',
    description: 'Host description with \\n\\n for paragraph breaks...'
}
```
