# Transform Website to Saturdata Podcast Site

## Project Overview

Transform the current personal portfolio website (Shifra Williams) into the official website for Saturdata Podcast. This involves updating all content, navigation, styling, and functionality to reflect the podcast brand and purpose.

## Context

**Saturdata** is your favorite weekend data podcast where we teach as much as we learn, creating community one episode at a time.

Saturdata humanizes the data world for the next generation of analysts, scientists, and engineers. Join hosts Shifra Williams and Sam LaFell every weekend as they share the journey of building data careers - the wins, the struggles, and everything in between. Perfect for students, career switchers, and early-career data people who want authentic advice from people who actually know what it's like to walk in your shoes.

### 4. About Section - Host Profiles
Transform the current about section into a "Meet Your Hosts" section with two host profiles:

#### Shifra Williams Profile:
- **Title**: Co-host & Developer Relations Advocate
- **Content**: Adapt existing about content, emphasizing her role as podcast co-host and her expertise in data science education and developer relations. Mention her experience in making complex technical concepts accessible.

#### Sam LaFell Profile:
- **Title**: Co-host & Data Engineer
- **Content**: 
"ðŸš€ Data Engineer | MLOps Enthusiast | Building Smarter Data Pipelines

Sam started his career as a Data Scientist, but quickly realized that messy data and inefficient pipelines were the real bottlenecks. Now, as a Data Engineer, he focuses on building scalable, reliable, and efficient data systems that empower organizations to make smarter decisions.

**What Sam does:**
- Architects and optimizes data pipelines (because bad data slows everything down)
- Works across Python, SQL, and cloud platforms like AWS & Azure to build resilient data solutions
- Bridges the gap between Data Science & Engineering, ensuring models don't just get builtâ€”they get deployed and deliver real value

**Tech Sam works with:**
Python, SQL, Snowflake, Databricks, and whatever else it takes to make data flow seamlessly.

**Why he does it:**
Sam believes data should be an asset, not a liability. Whether it's optimizing pipelines, improving data quality, or helping teams scale, he loves making complex data problems simple. He's also building his own business, helping organizations level up their data infrastructureâ€”because great data systems should be the norm, not the exception."

### 5. Remove Sections

### 6. Episodes Section (Replace Speaking Section)
Transform the speaking section into an episodes section:

- **Season 0 content**:
  - Episode 1 card with:
    - **Title**: "Welcome to Saturdata" (or actual episode title)
    - **Description**: Brief episode description
    - **Links**: YouTube and Spotify buttons
    - **Thumbnail**: Placeholder for episode artwork

- **Keep**: Current responsive design, dark mode functionality, and overall sleek aesthetic

### 9. Footer Updates
- **Copyright**: Change to "Â© 2025 Saturdata Podcast. Built with passion for the data community." using a function to find the current year rather than hardcoding 2025
- **Remove acknowledgments section**: Replace with podcast-specific credits if needed

### 10. Additional Considerations
- **Images**: Use the shif and sam images as well as the logo images

## Technical Implementation Notes
- Maintain current responsive design patterns
- Keep dark mode functionality intact
- Preserve current animation and interaction patterns
- Update color schemes consistently throughout
- Ensure all links are functional and point to correct destinations
- Test on mobile and desktop after implementation

## Content Tone and Voice
- Professional but approachable
- Community-focused
- Educational and encouraging
- Authentic and relatable (matching the "people who actually know what it's like to walk in your shoes" messaging)

This transformation should result in a professional podcast website that maintains the current site's technical excellence while completely rebranding it for Saturdata Podcast's community-focused mission.
